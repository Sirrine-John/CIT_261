Purpose
    To help someone research and determine the best Pokemon to use in a specific battle situation.
    I want to expand on my lookup i did for the first Block and bring in more information and a greater level of detail.
    I want to be able to save a user's list of Captured Pokemon and then select the top ones from thier list that would do well against another Pokemon in battle.
    I want it to look a lot more polished than the current one as well with mobile friendly buttons and possibly swipe capabilities.
Audience
    Pokemon fans. People that either play the Pokemon card game or the Pokemon Go App for mobile
Data sources
    External API - Pokemon API
    localStorage - save user preferences and saved data into local browser storage
    local JSON file. - possibly store data pulled from the API into a local JSON file so I don't have to query every time
Initial Module list
Wireframes for each view of your application - I will still have to work that up.  I am thinking at least 4-5 pages.  Lookup basic info. All Details. User Pokemon. Suggestion list.
Colors/Typography/specific Element styling - Need to stick to the "Pokemon" themed colors of Red, White, Blue, Yellow, Black.  All very eye popping colors, not subtle at all.

Schedule to provide yourself mile markers along the way to help you stay on target. - Still have to work on getting a schedule worked up to finish my tasks.  I plan on laying out the different portions and attacking one piece at a time.  Data pull from API, then input, then JSON storage and retreval, then suggestion pokemon comparison, then Front end design.
