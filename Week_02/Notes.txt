CHAPTER 2
An Expression is a line of code that produces a value.
A statement is information that "Affects the World" and is kept on a line in the code
Bindings are also known as Variables
"LET" can set multiple Variables
var = Variables || const = Constants

CHAPTER 3
Functions is a variable with code behind it
Scope goes from the top down, code inside can see what is above it but code outside cannot see what is inside Functions
If you use "function" to declare a function, then it is available anywhere in the code.  Other function variables work in a "top down" fasion
Arrow functions work nearly the same as "function" expressions
Be carefull not to make infinate loops:
    function chicken() {
        return egg();
    }
    function egg() {
        return chicken();
        }
    console.log(chicken() + " came first.");
    // â†’ ??
**Recursive functions need "RETURN" in front of the recursive call.

CHAPTER 4
Comparing objects using == compares the "identity" of the object, not its values
You cannot add properties to "string" "number" or "boolean" variables
"Math" contains many mathimatical functions that we can use for calculations
